## Who are We

The Linux Club at Kennesaw State University (LCKSU) is commited to being a beacon of linux information, for experienced and unexperienced members to share, collaborate, and further expand their knowledge of Linux and UNIX-adjacent operating systems. Founded in the fall of 2024 LCKSU has obtained well over 100 members across our various platforms and has built a strong community fostering collaboration within the Linux community here.

We meet weekly every friday starting on January 23 this year, from 4PM well into the evening, covering a range of topics from customization to installing from scratch. No matter your skill level there are plenty of members who are eager to assist you in whatever Linux project you are interested in. Don't have a computer to spare? No Worries! we have a collection of computers and hardware so that you can "break" our stuff, not yours.

Every week we will begin meetings with topic where we discuss a certain, more focused, aspect of linux. After about 30 minutes we break up and work on individual projects or classwork. Feel free to request your own member topic or even just work on a personal project.
